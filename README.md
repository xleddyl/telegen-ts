# Telegen-TS

A simple and effective library that solely provides an implementation of the official [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api). The webhook and polling mechanisms are not included, as this module is meant for custom logic implementation.

- Current wrapper version: [**Bot API 6.4**](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#december-30-2022)

## üìö Docs

This module doesn't need much documentation as all the infos can be retrieved from the official telegram's docs: <https://core.telegram.org/bots/api>

However all the methods and types are well documented within the editor's linter üòâ

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

```cli
npm install @xleddyl/telegen-ts
```

```js
const { TelegenTS, Types } = require('@xleddyl/telegen-ts')

const TOKEN = '1234...' // token that BotFather gives you
const bot = new TelegenTS(TOKEN)
```

- `TelegenTS` is a class from which all the [Available methods](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#available-methods) can be called (alongside with the ones explained [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#getting-updates))
- `Types` contains all the [Available types](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#available-types) used as return values/function parameters (alongside with the ones explained [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#getting-updates))
  - suitable for type casting in TypeScript
  - note: for return types manual inference is required üò¢ (read the docs to determine the return type of methods)

## ü§ñ Example

Get the latest message sent to the bot and respond with the same text

```js
const bot = new TelegenTS(TOKEN)

const msg = (await bot.getUpdates()).pop() // .pop() to get only the last msg
await bot.sendMessage(msg.message.text, msg.message.chat.id, { reply_to_message_id: msg.message.message_id })
```
